# Industrial-Human-Resource-Geo-Visualization
Updating and visualizing workforce data in India using EDA, NLP, and ML. Delivering accurate insights for policy-making and resource planning.
This project cleans & analyzes workforce data in India. It creates visualizations to show worker distribution by industry and state, using NLP to categorize industries. The goal is to inform policymakers and identify areas for training and improvement.

Workflow: Industrial Human Resource Geo-Visualization

1.Data Acquisition: Download or access the provided CSV datasets containing workforce information.

2.Data Inventory: Document the number and names of CSV files, identifying any potential duplicates.

3.Data Understanding: Briefly review the data structure and variable names in each CSV file.

4.Data Merging: Combine all relevant CSV files into a single, comprehensive dataframe.

5.Data Cleaning:

1: Identify and handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).

2: Address inconsistencies in data formats (e.g., date formats, units).

6.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Initial: Get a high-level overview of worker distribution across industries and states.

7.Feature Engineering (Part 1): Create new features if necessary (e.g., total workforce per state).

8.Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyze text data related to industries using NLP techniques.

9.Feature Engineering (Part 2): Use NLP insights to group similar business categories into broader industry sectors (e.g., Retail, Manufacturing).

10.Data Cleaning (Part 3): Address any errors or inconsistencies identified during initial EDA.

11.EDA :

Deeper Dive: Analyze worker demographics within key industries.

Regional Focus: Explore regional variations in workforce composition across states.

12.Visualization Preparation: Prepare data for visualization using appropriate libraries (e.g., Plotly).

13.Visualization Development

Part 1: Create a map visualizing worker distribution across states and industries.

Part 2: Develop additional visualizations to explore industry-specific trends (e.g., bar charts for worker demographics).

14.Streamlit App Development

Part 1: Set up the Streamlit framework to build the interactive dashboard.

Part 2: Implement interactive filters for industry, state, and worker category (main/marginal).

Part 3: Integrate visualizations into the Streamlit dashboard for dynamic exploration.

Expected Outcomes:

1.Improved understanding of India's workforce landscape.

2.Identification of areas requiring targeted training programs.

3.Data-driven support for informed policymaking and employment planning.

4.This project combines data science and visualization to create a valuable tool for stakeholders interested in India's workforce.

some real-world examples that share similar goals:

A.US Bureau of Labor Statistics: The BLS https://www.bls.gov/ publishes a vast amount of data on the US workforce, including industry breakdowns by state and demographics. They use interactive charts and maps to visualize this data, allowing users to explore trends and identify areas with high concentrations of specific industries.

B.Burning Glass Technologies: This company uses AI and machine learning to analyze labor market data. They provide insights on in-demand skills, job growth projections, and wage information across different regions and industries. This helps businesses make informed decisions about talent acquisition and training programs.

C.Skilling India Mission: This initiative by the Government of India focuses on improving the skills of the workforce to meet industry demands. They use data analytics to identify skill gaps and develop targeted training programs across various sectors.

These examples showcase how data visualization and analysis are used to understand workforce demographics, industry trends, and skill requirements. This information is then used to inform policy decisions, training programs, and overall workforce development strategies.

In conclusion,

1.Regional Distribution of Workers: West Bengal emerges as the state with the highest total number of workers, indicating a significant workforce presence in the region. This suggests a robust economic activity and employment opportunities in West Bengal. Rajasthan follows closely behind, indicating a substantial workforce contributing to the state's economy.

2.Gender Distribution in Rural and Urban Areas: The analysis highlights an interesting trend in the distribution of female workers between rural and urban areas. It is observed that rural areas have a higher proportion of female workers compared to urban areas. This phenomenon may reflect the nature of employment opportunities and socio-economic factors influencing workforce participation in different regions.

This project serves as a valuable tool to ensure a more informed and data-driven approach to managing India's human resources within the industrial sector.
